mass relations.  All are zero-sorry; standard Mathlib axioms only.  The
definitions below are *concrete numerical / geometric objects*, NOT axioms or
hypotheses about physical content.

### Interpretive claims (NOT proved as physical content)

The following are **interpretations** offered by the structural theorems.
They are not Lean-provable physical facts; they are Lean-decidable arithmetic
facts about specific concrete numerical objects.

| ID | Claim | Module | Tag |
|----|---|---|---|
| MR-I1 | π/6 = SU(3)_flavor Weyl-chamber half-opening angle (TT structural angle) | MassRelations.UpLeptonCyclotomic, SU3FlavorCartan | interpretation |
| MR-I2 | 9 = number of gauge bosons coupling to right-handed down-type quarks (SU(3)_C adjoint + U(1)_Y) | MassRelations.ClebschGordan | interpretation |
| MR-I3 | The SU(5) 45-adjoint is a subrep of the SO(10) 126-plet under SO(10)→SU(5) branching | MassRelations.ClebschGordan | interpretation (well-known group-theory fact, here verified via dimension sum 1+5+10+15+45+50 = 126) |
| MR-I4 | The shared denominator-9 between α (VV α denominator) and γ (gcd of dim 45 and 126) suggests both arise from the same EFT integration | MassRelations.ClebschGordan | interpretation (no physical-Lagrangian Lean derivation yet) |

**Status note (Round 16):** the original TT structural-angle interpretation
("the SU(3) Weyl rotation per generation is π/6, scaled by 2^g") was tested
and the COMPACT-SU(3) character mechanism was definitively ruled out.  See
ugp-physics Lab Notes 21 for full reasoning.  Best remaining candidate
mechanism (Lab Notes 21 §6 Option a) is the binary cascade of π/6 phase
shifts with 2^g accumulation per generation.

**Round 19 update:** the binary cascade is now Lean-formalised in
`UgpLean.MassRelations.BinaryCascade` (theorem `cascadeState_eq_TT`).  The
*mathematical* equivalence between the cascade and the TT formula is proved.
The *physical* realisation (which UV mechanism — U(1) flavor charge doubling,
heavy-fermion tower, affine Cartan translation — implements the cascade)
remains Claim C, open research.

**Round 31 update (β = π/8 STRUCTURALLY FIXED):** Priority 5 (β discrimination among π/8, 2/5, 1/φ²) is closed.  `UgpLean.MassRelations.FroggattNielsen.beta_TT_equals_pi_div_eight` proves the structural identity `−log(ε_2) = π/8`, so β is not an empirical fit parameter but rather derived from the Round-22 Cartan-potential global minimum at φ_2 = −π/8.  Empirical discrimination at current PDG precision ALREADY rules out β = 2/5 (6.7σ, dominated by precise m_t) and β = 1/φ² (3.6σ); π/8 fits at 2.5σ consistent with data.  No alternative candidate has a comparable structural derivation in the framework.  See ugp-physics Lab Notes 31.

**Round 33 update (Priority 7 Phase II — Koide):** Paper 1 OP(vii) / 4.4 — the longest-standing Koide-relation open problem — sees structural progress but not yet full closure.  `UgpLean.MassRelations.KoideClosedForm` adds seven theorems:
- `cos_sq_pi_div_twelve` (cos²(π/12) = (2+√3)/4)
- `two_plus_sqrt3_eq` ((2+√3) = 4·cos²(π/12))
- `one_plus_sqrt3_sq` and `one_plus_sqrt3_sq_eq_eight_cos_sq` ((1+√3)² = 8·cos²(π/12))
- `koide_solved_form_root` (closed form r_τ = 2(r_e+r_μ) + √3·√(r_e²+4r_e r_μ+r_μ²))
- `koide_quadratic_discriminant_form` and `koide_iff_twoS_sq_eq_threeN` (45°-cone reformulation).

Empirical (COMP-P01-GGG): PDG lepton vector at 44.99974° (0.95 arcsec from 45°); m_τ predicted from (m_e, m_μ) at 61 ppm = 0.91σ_PDG (within PDG 1σ).  Koide is structurally identified as a cyclotomic-12 algebraic identity, same atom family as α = π/6 in Round 13's TT derivation.  Full Phase III/IV flow construction (03_SPEC) is still open.  See ugp-physics Lab Notes 33.

**Round 34 update (Priority 7 Phase III/IV — Koide Newton-step flow):** 03_SPEC Phase III/IV completed via the partial-win (a)+(b)+(d) pattern explicitly flagged in 03_SPEC §1.  `UgpLean.MassRelations.KoideNewtonFlow` adds 15 theorems (0 sorry, 0 axioms): the operator `U(v) = v − (q(v)/|∇q|²)·∇q` is S_3-equivariant (three generator-cases proved individually), fixes every point of the null cone `{q = 0}`, and is UGP-native (polynomial + one division by a polynomial).  Empirical (COMP-P01-HHH): 100% of 1000 random v ∈ [0.01, 5.0]³ converge to the null cone in 5 Newton iterations; S_3-equivariance verified at machine precision (2.3e-15).  R34-B identifies the structural obstruction to full (c) closure: at PDG v* the three Koide root-equations require the (+,-,-) root pattern (largest component is +root, middle and smallest are −root), which is asymmetric under S_3 — hence no S_3-equivariant polynomial operator with v* as a nontrivial fixed point AND exact off-cone q-conservation can exist.  OP(vii) / 4.4 upgraded from "research-grade open" to "partially closed with UGP-native dynamical operator exhibited."  See ugp-physics Lab Notes 34.

**Round 35 update (Priority 8 Phase C — Lean physical-mass bridge):** 02_SPEC §D.4 "E_base Lean bridge" closed for UpLeptonFormulaHolds, DownRationalFormulaHolds, and the Koide identity.  `UgpLean.MassRelations.PhysicalMasses` defines the full physical-mass chain `(m_e, m_μ) → predictedLepton → predictedUpType → predictedDownType` via the Lean-certified TT + VV + Koide closed form, and adds 8 theorems (0 sorry, 0 axioms) proving TT, VV, Koide identities hold by construction on the predicted physical masses.  The previously `True → trivial` FormulaHolds placeholders are now actual theorems on Lean-valued physical masses.  Residual open problem (R35 Priority 8 Phase A/B negative): structural anchor for m_μ given m_e at DL ≤ 3 is MAP (COMP-P01-III, consistent with prior SC-K, SC-BB negatives).  OP(i)-B sharpens from "hierarchy of 8 R_g not reproduced" to "1 remaining empirical scale input (m_μ) at DL ≤ 3."  See ugp-physics Lab Notes 35.

**Round 21 update (FIRST UV-COMPLETION REALISED):** Claim C now has a
concrete physics model.  `UgpLean.MassRelations.FroggattNielsen` implements
a **two-flavon Froggatt-Nielsen model with doubled FN charges**, reproducing
TT exactly via theorem `fnLogYukawaRatio_eq_TT`.  Lepton FN_1 charges
follow the doubling pattern (1, 2, 4) per generation; up-type FN_1 are all
zero; flavon VEVs are `ε_1 = e^(−π/3)`, `ε_2 = e^(−π/8)` (both < 1,
FN-natural).  Three residual structural questions logged for Round 22+:
(i) why doubled charges; (ii) why transcendental VEVs; (iii) why two
flavons.  Possible link to Claim A: π/3 = 2·π/6 ties ε_1's exponent to
the SU(3)_flavor Cartan-bisector angle.

**Rounds 22–25 update (residual sub-questions partially closed):**
- **Round 22 sub-(ii):** Cartan-invariant flavon potential `V = -a·cos(6 φ_1) - b·cos(16 φ_2)` has the FN VEVs as global minima; theorem `fn_vevs_are_potential_minima`.  Z_6 directly ties to Claim A.  Z_16 origin remains conjectural (leading candidate: SO(10) 16-spinor R-symmetry).
- **Round 23 sub-(i):** Z_2-orbifold-depth function `2^(g-1)` matches FN charge magnitudes; theorem `binaryTreeDepth_matches_FN_charge_magnitude`.  Heterotic Z_2^n orbifold is leading candidate UV origin.
- **Round 24 (heavy-fermion-tower):** EFT-DUAL to the FN-doubled model; not a distinct UV completion but a different formulation.  Theorem `tower_eq_FN`.
- **Round 25 (neutrino predictions):** naive FN-doubled extension to neutrinos (q_νR = q_lep) is FALSIFIED by data (predicts 10⁵ hierarchy; observed 10–50). Modified extension with anti-doubled q_νR charges is qualitatively consistent — concrete PMNS prediction for DUNE δ_CP is open Round-26+ work. KATRIN bound m_β < 0.45 eV is trivially satisfied.
