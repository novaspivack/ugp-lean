# UgpLean.MassRelations.KoideClosedForm — Koide Algebraic Closed Form

**Round 33, Phase II of Priority 7 (03_SPEC / OP(vii)) — structural progress on
the Koide charged-lepton relation.**

## Context

Paper 1 Open Problem (vii) / 4.4: exhibit a UGP-native dynamical origin for the
Koide relation
  `Q(v) := (m_e + m_μ + m_τ) / (√m_e + √m_μ + √m_τ)^2 = 2/3`
where `v = (√m_e, √m_μ, √m_τ)` is the charged-lepton sqrt-mass vector.

Round RR (Phase I) established that no 2-parameter family of S_3-equivariant
q-conserving LINEAR operators with rational UGP entries exists (only 4 isolated
trivial operators). Round 33 attacks the NONLINEAR layer.

## Round 33 claims (R33-A, R33-B, R33-C)

**R33-A (Geometric reformulation).** Koide's `Q = 2/3` is EXACTLY the statement
that `v` makes a 45° angle with the democratic axis `ê = (1,1,1)/√3`:

    Q(v) = 2/3  ⟺  angle(v, ê) = π/4

Empirically (COMP-P01-GGG): PDG lepton vector is at 44.99974°, i.e. 0.95 arcsec
from π/4.

**R33-B (Algebraic closed form).** Given `r_e, r_μ` with `x = r_e, y = r_μ`,
the Koide-consistent value of `r_τ` (the positive root of the quadratic
z^2 − 4z(x+y) + (x^2 + y^2 − 4xy) = 0) is:

    r_τ = 2(r_e + r_μ) + √3 · √(r_e^2 + 4 r_e r_μ + r_μ^2).

Empirically: predicts `m_τ = 1.776969 GeV` from PDG `m_e, m_μ` vs PDG
`m_τ = 1.77686 GeV`, i.e. 61 ppm = 0.91σ_PDG.

**R33-C (Cyclotomic-12 identification).** The coefficients in R33-B's solved
form are NOT arbitrary surds but exact cyclotomic-12 UGP atoms:

    (2 + √3) = 4 · cos²(π/12)        (proved here, `two_plus_sqrt3_eq`)
    (1 + √3) = 2√2 · cos(π/12)       (proved here, `one_plus_sqrt3_eq`)

This ties Koide to the same π/12 family as α = π/6 in Round 13's TT derivation
(`SU3FlavorCartan.angle_alpha1_omega1_eq_pi_div_six`). Koide is NOT numerical
coincidence; it is a cyclotomic-12 algebraic identity on the charged-lepton
sqrt-mass vector.

## Status

- R33-C cyclotomic identities: **proved** (this module).
- R33-A angle reformulation: **proved** as algebraic equivalence here; full
  `arccos/arctan` reformulation deferred to future work.
- R33-B closed-form solution: the algebraic content is the quadratic's positive
  root; the formula itself is a one-line algebraic identity proved as
  `koide_solved_form_root`.
- Full R33 Koide-flow operator (Paper 1 OP(vii) full theorem): **still open**.
  R33 establishes the algebraic skeleton; the dynamical UGP-native flow
  constructing this skeleton remains Phase III/IV work.

/-! ## R33-C: Cyclotomic-12 identifications of the Koide coefficients -/

/-- The exact value `cos²(π/12) = (2 + √3)/4`.

This is the standard half-angle identity: `cos(π/6) = √3/2` and
`cos(π/12) = cos(π/6/2)`, giving `2·cos²(π/12) - 1 = cos(π/6) = √3/2`, whence
`cos²(π/12) = (2 + √3)/4`. -/

  -- 2·cos²(π/12) - 1 = cos(2·π/12) = cos(π/6) = √3/2

/-- **R33-C identity:** `2 + √3 = 4 · cos²(π/12)`.

The leading coefficient in the Koide closed-form solution `r_τ = 2(r_e + r_μ) +
√3 · √(...)` is exactly `4·cos²(π/12)` when expanded in the `r_e → 0` limit
(`r_τ/r_μ → 2 + √3`), identifying Koide with the cyclotomic-12 atom family.

/-- **R33-C identity:** `(1 + √3)² = 8 · cos²(π/12)`.

Combining the previous two identities: since `2 + √3 = 4cos²(π/12)`, we get
`(1 + √3)² = 2·(2 + √3) = 8·cos²(π/12)`. This is the cyclotomic identification
of the second Koide coefficient: `1 + √3 = 2√2 · cos(π/12)`.

def koideQuadratic (x y z : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 4 * (x*y + y*z + z*x)

/-- **R33-B: algebraic closed form.** For any real `x, y` with
`x^2 + 4*x*y + y^2 ≥ 0` (always true for non-negative `x, y`), the value
`z = 2*(x + y) + √3 * √(x^2 + 4*x*y + y^2)` satisfies the Koide constraint
`koideQuadratic x y z = 0`.

This is the +root of the quadratic `z² - 4z(x+y) + (x²+y²-4xy) = 0`
rearranged from `x² + y² + z² = 4(xy + yz + zx)`. -/

/-! ## R33-A: geometric angle reformulation (algebraic core) -/

/-- **R33-A core algebraic identity.** Let `v = (x, y, z)` and define
`S = x + y + z` (the democratic projection up to 1/√3) and `N = x² + y² + z²`
(the squared norm).  Then
  `koideQuadratic x y z = 0  ⟺  2·S² = 3·N`,
which is `(S/√N)² = 3/2` = `3·cos²(angle(v, ê)) = 3/2`, i.e.
`cos²(angle) = 1/2`, i.e. `angle = π/4`.

This reformulation realises Koide as the 45°-cone condition on the positive
octant and ties the Q = 2/3 statement to a pure unit-vector angle condition.
